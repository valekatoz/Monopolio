# Monopolio

Monopolio is a game inspired by the famous Monopoly, created in Java by four high school seniors as a group project (Valentino, [Tommaso](https://github.com/TommyPatriarca), [Filippo](https://github.com/mcnardi00), [Giacomo](https://github.com/Suttix56)). This game challenges players to buy and sell cities in Valtellina, a valley located in northern Italy.
